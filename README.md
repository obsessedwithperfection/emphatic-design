# emphatic-design
emphatic-design is a wordpress theme. When I started this project then my main goal was to make this theme highly performant by reducing library size but I could not do that due to shortage of time. I am extremely busy and I can not afford time to make this wordpress theme more better so if someone wants to learn from this theme then he or she is most welcome. Thank you.

"I’m not saying that using existing software or libraries is bad. I’m saying that it’s always
a tradeoff between minimizing effort on one side and minimizing redundant code on the
other side. I’m saying that you should consider writing your own code when the percentage
of features you need from existing libraries is tiny (let’s say less than 20%). It might not be
worth carrying the extra 80% forever".        —Lea Verou
